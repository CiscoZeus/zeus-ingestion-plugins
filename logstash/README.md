# Logstash Output Plugin to Cisco Zeus

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash).
It is a simple wrapper of the [Ruby Zeus Client](https://github.com/CiscoZeus/ruby-zeusclient).

##Developing

First of all you'll need JRuby, since Logstash is written in ruby and runs on the JVM.
You can get it [in their website](http://jruby.org/download) or through [RVM](https://rvm.io/) like this:

###Building

```sh
jruby -S bundle install
jruby -S gem build logstash-output-CiscoZeus.gemspec
```

##Usage

###Installation

```sh
logstash-plugin install logstash-output-CiscoZeus-0.1.0.gem
```

###Configuration

```
output {
  CiscoZeus {
    token => "my_token"
    log_name => "my_desired_log_name"
    endpoint => "myendpoint.ciscozeus.io"
  }
}
```
